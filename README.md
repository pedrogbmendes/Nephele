Optimization of cloud resources for machine learning applications.
Minimizes the cost subject to quality of sercive constrains.
Uses the fraction of the dataset to train in order to decrease in a control way the training time and, hence, the cost, and ensures the user-defined constrains in time, accuracy and a budget for exploration
