Optimization of cloud resources for machine learning applications.

Minimizes the cost subject to quality of sercive constrains.

Uses the fraction of the dataset to train in order to decrease in a control way the training time and, hence, the cost, and ensures the user-defined constrains in time, accuracy and a budget for exploration.

Adds a new dimension to teh search space that corresponds to the dataset size used to train.
